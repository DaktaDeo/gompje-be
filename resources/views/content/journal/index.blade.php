            <p>
                I have written a LOT of journal entries. First in a paper journal, then in a digital journal. Thousands.

                Writing & drawing helps me a lot to get my thoughts in order. I have a lot of thoughts, and I guess I
                need to get them out of my head.
                Almost all of these are very private.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                But I sometimes write stuff that I feel like sharing. So here we are.
