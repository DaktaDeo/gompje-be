                I read a lot of books, you can find a list of them on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57591973-veerle-deschepper"
                                                                         class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500">Goodreads</a>.
                Actually I prefer to listen to them, that way my mind can wander and I can do other things at the same time.
                Most, if not all, the books I read are English, so I listen to them in English.
                I also listen to a lot of podcasts, mostly in English as well. I also watch a lot of movies and series, but I don't write reviews about them.

                Can you believe Github Copilot has generated the above blurb? I'm not sure if I should be impressed or scared...

                It even has generated that last sentence, which is a bit scary.. it's like it can read my mind. AGAIN! ðŸ˜° ðŸ˜± ??
